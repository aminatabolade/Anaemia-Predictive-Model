# Anaemia-Predictive-Model
This model is built with sci-kit learn to predict if a patient is likely to suffer from anemia or not
Anaemia is a blood disorder in which the blood has a reduced ability to carry oxygen due to a lower than normal number of red blood cells, or a reduction in the amount of haemoglobin. 
Anemia dataset was gotten from Kaggle and contains attributes: Gender, Hemoglobin, MCHC, MCV, MCH and Results.
Gender: 0 - male, 1 - female
Hemoglobin: Hemoglobin is a protein in your red blood cells that carries oxygen to your body's organs and tissues and transports carbon dioxide from your organs and tissues back to your lungs
MCH: MCH is short for "mean corpuscular hemoglobin." It's the average amount in each of your red blood cells of a protein called hemoglobin, which carries oxygen around your body.
MCHC: MCHC stands for mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration. It's a measure of the average concentration of hemoglobin inside a single red blood cell.
MCV: MCV stands for mean corpuscular volume. An MCV blood test measures the average size of your red blood cells.
Results: 0- not anemic, 1-anemic
